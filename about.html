        My name is Sabrina Mohammed, a senior Computer 
        Information Technology and Graphic Design student at 
        Minnesota State University, Mankato. I am inspired to 
        pursue a path in cloud technology where I could design 
        solutions that benefit others. Whether through code, 
        design, or strategy, I’m driven by the idea of creating tools
        that are thoughtful, efficient, and impactful.

        Growing up, I was all about the arts — sketching, 
        designing, and expressing myself visually. But 
        everything shifted when I started working in a 
        healthcare clinic. I saw firsthand how outdated 
        systems affected patient care, and that sparked 
        a new passion: using technology to fix real-world 
        problems. I began my journey as a full-stack 
        developer, building cloud-based solutions to 
        streamline clinic operations.

        While I loved solving problems with code, I realized 
        the real magic happens when tech meets thoughtful 
        design.  It wasn’t until my high school advisor 
        introduced me to UX/UI design that everything clicked. 

        Today, I combine my background in cloud development
        with my love for design to create user-first, scalable 
        solutions that work just as beautifully as they look.

        I’m actively involved in communities 
        that support diversity, creativity, and technical growth.
        As Technical Director for ColorStack MNSU, I help lead 
        initiatives that empower underrepresented students in 
        tech through workshops and events. I served as a Senator 
        for the National Society of Black Engineers, where I support 
        outreach and community-building efforts, and I’m also a 
        member of AIGA, where I explore the intersection of design
        and technology. Currently, I’ve been expanding my 
        technical foundation as a CodePath Intermediate 
        Cybersecurity Fellow, where I’m gaining hands-on 
        experience in areas like threat detection, network security,
        and ethical hacking.

        Outside of tech, I love expressing myself through 
        creativity—sketching, painting, more recently, exploring 
        candle making. I’m always eager to try and learn new
        things, and that curiosity fuels many of my hobbies and 
        side projects. From hands-on crafts to digital design, I 
        enjoy experimenting across different mediums. In the 
        coming years, I hope to continue growing by learning 
        from diverse communities and blending my passions in 
        ways that bring both creativity and meaning into my work.
